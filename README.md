# PolicyBot – Policy Exploration Platform

🔗 **Live Demo:** https://cerai.iitm.ac.in/policybot/

PolicyBot is a conversational interface for exploring government and institutional policy documents.

It enables users to ask questions in natural language and receive answers grounded directly in official policy texts, with clear citations for verification.

This repository contains the complete frontend implementation of the platform.

## Overview

Government and legal documents are often:

PolicyBot simplifies policy exploration by combining conversational AI with evidence-backed responses.

The platform allows users to:
- Ask questions in plain language  
- Receive responses grounded in source documents  
- View clear citations  
- Explore policy collections through an intuitive interface  

The system prioritizes transparency and evidence over generative speculation.
